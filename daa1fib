Write a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers and find its step count.with recuson


# Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term

n= int(input("How many terms? "))

n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

if n <= 0:
   print("Please enter positive no")
elif n == 1:

   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",n,":")
   print(n1)
else:
   
   print("Fibonacci sequence:")
   while count < n:
       print(n1)
       nth = n1 + n2
       # update values
       n1 = n2
       n2 = nth
       count += 1
# Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term

n= int(input("How many terms? "))

n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0

if n <= 0:
   print("Please enter positive no")
elif n == 1:

   print("Fibonacci sequence upto",n,":")
   print(n1)

   while count < n:

       n2 = nth
       count += 1
